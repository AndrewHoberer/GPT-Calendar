# Basic Function Testing Instructions

This folder contains unit tests for basic project functionality using Vitest.

## How to Run the Tests

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root of the project directory.

2. Install all necessary dependencies (if not already done):
   npm install

3. Run the unit tests:
   npm run test

This will execute all `.test.ts` files using Vitest and display the results in the terminal.

## Test File

- `example.test.ts`: Tests a basic add() function for different cases.
